# Enhancing Performance and Stability in Networked Control Systems (PLC-based) with Adaptive Computation Switching Policy for Industrial Automation 


## Introduction
The interactive dimension of CPS with the human-in-the-loop exploits new horizons and unprecedented  collaboration of humans and machines. Edge Computing is  one of the integral parts in the Industrial revolution 5.0 that  enables data computation near to data source minimizing the  latency and exploring the new horizons of data informatics.  The issue is that the more we implement industry 5.0, the  bigger the payload for the data lakes as it needs to process  “everything” from everywhere. The payload that needs to be  processed by the data lake and the difference on each machine,  processes and products makes the data analytics portion  significantly complicated and expensive. The traditional  controllers like PLC, microcontroller, remote terminal unit  (RTU) are equipment with edge servers making the industrial  automation reliable and enabling AI implementation in real-time. Edge computing acts as an individual service that cloud  architecture offers. Field devices data are collected at their  source and computed by edge computing before sending to  cloud. PLC CPU doesn’t have the capacity to run AI and  complex algorithms. The combination of local controllers  (PLC, RTU) and Edge Computing offers optimized industrial  automation. Edge servers are connected wired/wireless with  the field devices and local controllers. Despite their flexibility,  there is always a chance for data loss in transmission due to  various factors like noise, power interference, poor physical  connection, and environment. As shown in figure 1, general  industrial automation hierarchy focused on multi-tier  computation is shown. The field devices are connected to local  controllers and responsible for controlling the actuators. The  edge servers can receive information from local controllers  and field devices. Edge servers process the data in real- time  to control the output and later upload the necessary  information to the cloud for further implementation.
